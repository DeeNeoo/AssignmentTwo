//The purpose and description of the application.

It is designed to help users study history by answering five True/False questions. It begins with a welcome screen where users can tap a “Begin” button to begin the quiz. The quiz consists of five True/False history questions stored in parallel arrays for the questions and answers. As users progress through the questions, they receive immediate feedback indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect, and a score is maintained, awarding one point for each correct answer. After all questions are answered, the app displays a score screen showing the total score along with a performance message—“Great job!” for scores of 3 or more, and “Keep practising!” for scores below 3. Additionally, a “Review” button allows users to go back and view all the questions along with the correct answers, helping reinforce learning.
